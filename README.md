### Project Title

  

Explore US Bikeshare Data

  

  

### Description

  

In this project, I learned how to use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities:

  

- Chicago

  

- New York City

  

- Washington.

  

I Learned how to write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

  

The user also can **filter** the data to get more accurate result by :

  

- The city

  

- The month

  

- Day of the week

  

And at the end, The user can get the following informations :

  

- Most frequent times of travel sorted by day and month

  

- Most popular stations and trips

  

- Total and average trip duration

  

- bikeshare user information

  

  

### Files used

- new_york_city.csv

  

- washington.csv
